You are fixing Copilot review comments on a pull request.

**Context (substituted by the caller):**
- Repository: OWNER/REPO_NAME
- Pull request: PR_NUMBER
- Branch: BRANCH
- Local clone: LOCAL_PATH
- Default branch: DEFAULT_BRANCH

## Step 1 — Wait for Copilot to review

Copilot needs time to analyse the PR. Sleep 3 minutes before the first check:

```bash
sleep 180
```

## Step 2 — Poll for Copilot review comments

Call `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with:
- `method`: `get_review_comments`
- `owner`: OWNER
- `repo`: REPO_NAME
- `pullNumber`: PR_NUMBER
- `perPage`: 100

Filter to comments where:
- `author` is `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- `is_resolved` is `false`
- `is_outdated` is `false`

If no matching comments are found, wait 60 seconds and retry — up to 3 retries total.
After 3 retries with no comments, exit gracefully with a note that Copilot has not reviewed yet.

## Step 3 — Fix applicable comments

For each unresolved, non-outdated Copilot comment:

1. Read the comment body carefully.
2. Decide if it is **code-fixable** — the fix must only touch files that exist in LOCAL_PATH.
   Skip comments that:
   - Are informational only (no concrete code change suggested)
   - Require changes outside the PR's scope
   - Are already addressed by a later commit on the branch (check `git log`)
3. For fixable comments: read the referenced file from LOCAL_PATH first, then apply the fix.

After processing all comments, check for changes:

```bash
git -C LOCAL_PATH diff --stat
```

If changes exist, commit and push:

```bash
git -C LOCAL_PATH add -A
git -C LOCAL_PATH commit -m "Address Copilot review comments"
git -C LOCAL_PATH push origin BRANCH --force-with-lease
```

## Step 4 — Report

Print a brief summary:
