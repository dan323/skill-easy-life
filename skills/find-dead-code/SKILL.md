# Find Dead Code

Identify code that is defined but never used: functions, classes, methods, variables, constants, types, imports, and exports. Reports candidates with file and line number. Accounts for patterns that make code appear unused but are actually invoked at runtime (dependency injection, reflection, serialization, entry points, decorators).

**This skill is read-only.** It produces a report. It does not delete or modify any file.

## Phase 1: Detect Languages and Tooling

```bash
# Identify languages present
find . -maxdepth 4 -not -path "*/.git/*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
  -not -path "*/vendor/*" -not -path "*/.venv/*" \
  -name "*.java" -o -name "*.kt" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" \
  -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.go" \
  -o -name "*.rs" -o -name "*.cs" -o -name "*.rb" -o -name "*.php" \
  | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10

# Check for installed static analysis tools
command -v deadcode rg eslint tsc pyflakes vulture jdeps 2>/dev/null
```

Detect the primary language(s) and check which dedicated tools are available. Use dedicated tools when available (they are more accurate than grep). Fall back to grep-based analysis when tools are absent. Run both in parallel when possible and merge results.

## Phase 2: Identify Safe Symbols (Never Flag These)

Before scanning for dead code, build a list of symbols that must never be reported, regardless of whether they appear to have no callers.

### Universal safe patterns

- **Entry points**: `main`, `Main`, `__main__`, `run`, `App`, `Application`, top-level script bodies.
- **Public API of a library**: any exported symbol in a package intended for external consumers. Infer from the presence of a `package.json` `"main"`/`"exports"` field, a `__init__.py` with `__all__`, a `pub` item in a crate, or a `public` method in a non-`internal` package.
- **Test helpers**: functions only called from test files are not dead — they serve the test suite. Exclude files matching `*_test.go`, `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.*`, `test_*.py`, `*Test.java`, etc.
- **Lifecycle callbacks**: `setUp`, `tearDown`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `componentDidMount`, `ngOnInit`, `onCreate`, `onDestroy`, etc.
- **Serialisation targets**: any class/struct that is read from or written to JSON, XML, YAML, or a database ORM (fields may only be accessed via reflection).
- **Event handlers and callbacks registered by name**: handler functions passed as strings to frameworks.

### Framework-specific safe patterns — Dependency Injection

Flag any symbol annotated with (or matched by) the patterns below as **injection-managed** and exclude it from the dead code report.

#### Java / Kotlin — Spring

```
@Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller, @RestController
@Bean, @Configuration, @Aspect
@Autowired, @Inject, @Value, @Qualifier
@EventListener, @Scheduled, @KafkaListener, @RabbitListener
@Entity, @MappedSuperclass, @Embeddable   ← JPA / Hibernate
@RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping,
@DeleteMapping, @PatchMapping             ← endpoint methods
```

```bash
grep -rn "@Component\|@Service\|@Repository\|@Controller\|@Bean\|@Autowired\|@Inject\|@Scheduled\|@EventListener\|@Entity\|@Mapping" \
  --include="*.java" --include="*.kt" .
```

#### Java / Kotlin — CDI (Jakarta EE)

```
@ApplicationScoped, @RequestScoped, @SessionScoped, @Dependent
@Named, @Produces, @Inject, @Observes
```

#### TypeScript / JavaScript — NestJS

```
@Injectable(), @Controller(), @Module()
@Get(), @Post(), @Put(), @Delete(), @Patch()
@Guard(), @Interceptor(), @Pipe(), @Middleware()
```

#### TypeScript / JavaScript — Angular

```
@Component(), @Directive(), @Pipe(), @Injectable()
@NgModule(), @Input(), @Output(), @HostListener()
```

#### Python — Flask / FastAPI / Django

```python
@app.route(...)        # Flask
@router.get(...)       # FastAPI
# Django: any class in views.py, models.py, admin.py, forms.py, serializers.py
# Django signals: receiver(signal)
```

#### C# — ASP.NET / Dependency Injection

```
[ApiController], [Route(...)], [HttpGet], [HttpPost]
[Service], [Inject]
Any class registered in Startup.cs / Program.cs via AddSingleton / AddScoped / AddTransient
```

#### Ruby — Rails

```ruby
# Any method in ApplicationController subclasses (routed actions)
# Any method in ActiveRecord models called by associations or callbacks
# before_action, after_action, around_action targets
# ActiveJob: perform method
```

If any DI framework is detected, add a section to the final report that lists the framework(s) found and the patterns used to exclude injection-managed code.

## Phase 3: Language-Specific Analysis

Run the appropriate strategy per detected language. For multi-language projects, run all relevant strategies.

---

### Python

**Preferred tool (if available):**

```bash
vulture . --min-confidence 60
```

**Grep fallback:**

```bash
# Collect all definitions
grep -rn "^\s*def \|^\s*class \|^\s*[A-Z_]\+\s*=" \
  --include="*.py" . > /tmp/py_defs.txt

# For each defined name, check if it appears elsewhere
# (subtract definition lines from total occurrences)
```

Key false-positive sources to exclude:
- `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, `__eq__`, and all other dunder methods.
- Any name listed in `__all__`.
- Pytest fixtures (functions decorated with `@pytest.fixture`).
- Click / Typer commands (`@cli.command()`, `@app.command()`).

---

### JavaScript / TypeScript

**Preferred tool (if available):**

```bash
# TypeScript: unused locals/parameters
tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters 2>&1

# ESLint with no-unused-vars
npx eslint . --rule '{"no-unused-vars": "error"}' 2>&1
```

**Grep fallback — imports:**

```bash
# Find all named imports
grep -rn "^import {" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" \
  --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" .

# For each imported name, count usages outside the import line
```

**Grep fallback — exports:**

```bash
# Find all exported symbols
grep -rn "^export \(function\|class\|const\|let\|var\|type\|interface\|enum\)" \
  --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
```

Key false-positive sources to exclude:
- Re-exports (`export { X } from './y'`) — X may be used by consumers.
- Default exports (harder to trace by name).
- Anything referenced in `index.ts` / `index.js` barrel files.
- Types and interfaces used only in type positions (still useful for documentation).
- `declare` statements in `.d.ts` files.

---

### Java / Kotlin

**Preferred tool (if available):**

```bash
# IntelliJ inspections via CLI (if configured)
# Or: PMD unused code rules
pmd check -d src -R category/java/bestpractices.xml/UnusedPrivateMethod,\
category/java/bestpractices.xml/UnusedPrivateField,\
category/java/bestpractices.xml/UnusedFormalParameter 2>&1
```

**Grep fallback:**

```bash
# Private methods — safest to flag (not accessible outside the class)
grep -rn "private\s\+\(static\s\+\)\?\w\+\s\+\w\+\s*(" \
  --include="*.java" .

# Private fields
grep -rn "private\s\+\(static\s\+\)\?\(final\s\+\)\?\w\+\s\+\w\+\s*[;=]" \
  --include="*.java" .

# Unused imports
grep -rn "^import " --include="*.java" .
```

**Confidence tiers for Java:**
- **High confidence (safe to flag)**: `private` methods and fields with no references in the same file.
- **Medium confidence**: package-private (`default`) symbols not referenced in the same package.
- **Low confidence / do not flag without warning**: `public` or `protected` symbols — they may be used by subclasses, external modules, or reflection.

Always apply DI annotation exclusions (Phase 2) before flagging any Java/Kotlin symbol.

---

### Go

The Go compiler already rejects unused imports and unused local variables. Focus on:

```bash
# Exported functions/types never referenced outside their own package
# (requires knowing the full module graph — approximate with grep)

# Unexported functions not referenced in any file
grep -rn "^func [a-z]" --include="*.go" . | \
  while IFS=: read file line decl; do
    name=$(echo "$decl" | grep -oP '(?<=func )\w+')
    count=$(grep -rn "\b${name}\b" --include="*.go" . | grep -v "^${file}:${line}:" | wc -l)
    [ "$count" -eq 0 ] && echo "$file:$line: unused func $name"
  done
```

Exclude:
- Functions matching `Test*`, `Benchmark*`, `Example*` (Go test conventions).
- `init()` functions (called automatically).
- Methods implementing a named interface (determine from `interface` declarations).

**Preferred tool:**

```bash
go build ./... 2>&1 | grep "declared and not used"
# For more: deadcode tool (golang.org/x/tools/cmd/deadcode)
deadcode -test ./... 2>&1
```

---

### Rust

```bash
cargo check 2>&1 | grep "warning: unused"
cargo clippy 2>&1 | grep "dead_code\|unused"
```

Look for:
- `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations — these suppress warnings and may indicate known dead code. List them explicitly.
- Items marked `pub` in a binary crate (not a library) that are never called.

---

### C# / .NET

**Preferred tool:**

```bash
dotnet build 2>&1 | grep "CS0168\|CS0169\|CS0219\|CS0649\|CS8019"
# CS0168: variable declared but never used
# CS0169: private field never used
# CS0219: variable assigned but value never used
# CS0649: field never assigned
# CS8019: unnecessary using directive
```

Exclude:
- Anything in DI registration (`services.Add*` in `Program.cs` / `Startup.cs`).
- Classes with `[Serializable]` or data contract attributes.
- ASP.NET controller actions (any `public` method in a class inheriting `ControllerBase`).

---

## Phase 4: Detect Reflection and Dynamic Dispatch Patterns

Before ranking findings, scan for patterns that invoke code by name at runtime. Any symbol reachable through these patterns must be flagged with a **reflection warning** rather than reported as dead.

### Reflection call patterns by language

#### Java / Kotlin

```bash
# Class.forName, getDeclaredMethod, getMethod, invoke, newInstance
grep -rn "Class\.forName\|getDeclaredMethod\|getMethod\b\|\.invoke(\|newInstance\(\)" \
  --include="*.java" --include="*.kt" .

# Spring's ApplicationContext.getBean — retrieves beans by name or type at runtime
grep -rn "getBean\b" --include="*.java" --include="*.kt" .

# Any string that matches a class or method name in the codebase
# e.g. "UserService" as a string literal near a reflection call
```

#### Python

```bash
# getattr, __import__, importlib, eval, exec
grep -rn "getattr\|__import__\|importlib\.import_module\|eval(\|exec(" \
  --include="*.py" .
```

Python `getattr(obj, name)` allows calling any method by string name. Any method on a class that is also passed through `getattr` in the same codebase is not safely removable.

#### JavaScript / TypeScript

```bash
# Bracket notation calls: obj["methodName"]() or obj[variable]()
grep -rn '\w\+\[["'"'"']\w' --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" \
  --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" .

# require() with dynamic arguments
grep -rn "require([^'\"]\|import(" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .
```

#### C# / .NET

```bash
grep -rn "\.GetMethod\b\|\.GetProperty\b\|\.Invoke\b\|Activator\.CreateInstance\|Type\.GetType" \
  --include="*.cs" .
```

#### Ruby

```bash
# send, public_send, method, const_get
grep -rn "\.send(\|\.public_send(\|\.method(\|Object\.const_get\|Module\.const_get" \
  --include="*.rb" .
```

### What to do with reflection findings

1. **If reflection is found, but no specific string matches the candidate symbol's name** — keep the finding at its original confidence tier; note that reflection exists in the project but does not appear to target this symbol.

2. **If a string literal matching the candidate's name appears near a reflection call** — downgrade the finding to **Low confidence** and add:

   > ⚠ Reflection risk: `"symbolName"` appears as a string literal near a reflection/dynamic dispatch call at `file:line`. This method may be invoked at runtime without a direct code reference. Verify before removing.

3. **If broad reflection is used (e.g. `getattr(obj, user_input)`, `Class.forName(config.get(...))`)** — add a project-level warning at the top of the report:

   > ⚠ This project uses dynamic method dispatch (reflection / `getattr` / `send`). Any symbol could potentially be called at runtime by name. Treat all Medium and Low confidence findings with extra caution and prefer running integration tests after any removal.

## Phase 4b: Rank Candidates by Confidence

Assign each finding a confidence tier before reporting.

| Tier       | Meaning                                   | Examples                                                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High**   | Almost certainly unused; safe to delete   | `private` method with zero references in the same file; local variable assigned but never read           |
| **Medium** | Likely unused, but verify before deleting | Package-private / internal symbol; exported function in a non-library project                            |
| **Low**    | Possibly unused, but deletion is risky    | `public` class; method that could be called via reflection or serialisation; anything near a DI boundary |

Never report Low-confidence findings without an explicit warning that they may be false positives.

## Phase 5: Output Report



Group findings by file. For each finding include: file path, line number, symbol type, symbol name, confidence tier, and a one-line reason.

```
## Dead Code Report

### Summary
- High confidence:   12 findings
- Medium confidence:  5 findings
- Low confidence:     3 findings
- DI-excluded:        8 symbols (Spring @Service / @Component)

---

### High Confidence

src/utils/StringHelper.java:42
  [private method] `normalizeWhitespace` — no references found in this file

src/utils/StringHelper.java:67
  [private field] `DEFAULT_LOCALE` — assigned but never read

src/models/User.py:18
  [import] `from datetime import timedelta` — `timedelta` not used in this file

---

### Medium Confidence

src/services/ReportService.java:110
  [package-private method] `buildCsvRow` — no references found in this package
  ⚠ Could be called by a subclass or a future addition — verify before removing.

---

### Low Confidence

src/api/UserController.java:88
  [public method] `getUserLegacy` — no call sites found in this codebase
  ⚠ Public methods may be called by external consumers or via reflection.
  ⚠ This class is a Spring @RestController — endpoint methods are invoked by the framework.

---

### DI-Managed Symbols (excluded from dead code)

Detected frameworks: Spring Boot (@Component, @Service, @RestController)

The following 8 symbols were found but excluded because they carry DI annotations:
  - UserService (@Service) — src/services/UserService.java:12
  - OrderRepository (@Repository) — src/repositories/OrderRepository.java:8
  ... (full list omitted for brevity — run with --verbose to see all)
```

### If no dead code is found

```
## Dead Code Report

No unused symbols found.

DI-managed symbols excluded from analysis: 14 (Spring Boot)
Files scanned: 87
```

### Recommended next steps

Always close the report with:
- Which dedicated tools (vulture, tsc, deadcode, PMD, etc.) would give more accurate results if not already run.
- A reminder that High-confidence findings are safe to act on; Medium and Low should be reviewed manually.
- A note that the report is a snapshot — dead code can be introduced by future changes, so running this periodically (e.g. as a CI step) is recommended.
