# Improve Logging

Audit a codebase's logging and produce a prioritized list of recommendations covering three areas: missing log statements, incorrect severity levels, and poor message quality. Also enforces (or proposes) a consistent logging pattern across the whole application.

**This skill is read-only.** It produces a recommendation report. It does not edit any file.

## Phase 1: Detect Languages and Logging Frameworks

```bash
# Identify languages
find . -maxdepth 4 -not -path "*/.git/*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
  -not -path "*/vendor/*" -not -path "*/.venv/*" \
  \( -name "*.py" -o -name "*.java" -o -name "*.kt" -o -name "*.ts" \
     -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.go" \
     -o -name "*.rs" -o -name "*.cs" -o -name "*.rb" \) \
  | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
```

Detect the logging framework in use per language:

| Language      | Frameworks to detect                                                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Python        | `import logging`, `from loguru`, `import structlog`                       |
| Java/Kotlin   | `import org.slf4j`, `import org.apache.logging`, `import io.github.oshai` |
| TypeScript/JS | `import winston`, `import pino`, `console.log/warn/error`                 |
| Go            | `import "log"`, `"go.uber.org/zap"`, `"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"`       |
| C#            | `ILogger`, `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`, `Serilog`, `NLog`              |
| Ruby          | `Rails.logger`, `Logger.new`                                              |

```bash
# Python
grep -rn "import logging\|from loguru\|import structlog" --include="*.py" . | head -5

# Java/Kotlin
grep -rn "import org.slf4j\|import org.apache.logging\|LoggerFactory\|KotlinLogging" \
  --include="*.java" --include="*.kt" . | head -5

# TypeScript/JS
grep -rn "require.*winston\|require.*pino\|import.*winston\|import.*pino\|console\.\(log\|warn\|error\|info\|debug\)" \
  --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.jsx" . | head -5

# Go
grep -rn '"log"\|"go.uber.org/zap"\|"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"\|"golang.org/x/exp/slog"' \
  --include="*.go" . | head -5
```

## Phase 2: Establish the Logging Pattern

Sample up to 20 existing log call sites to understand the current pattern (or absence of one):

```bash
# Python example — find log calls
grep -rn "logger\.\|logging\." --include="*.py" . | head -20

# Java/Kotlin example
grep -rn "log\.\(info\|debug\|warn\|error\|trace\)" --include="*.java" --include="*.kt" . | head -20

# Go example
grep -rn "log\.\|logger\.\|zap\.\|logrus\." --include="*.go" . | head -20
```

Read 3–5 representative files where logging is present to understand:

1. **Message style** — verb-first ("Processing request"), noun-first ("Request received"), or mixed?
2. **Context fields** — are structured fields used (e.g. `log.Info("done", "user_id", id)`)? Which fields appear consistently?
3. **Logger instantiation** — module-level singleton, passed via context, or created per function?
4. **Level discipline** — is DEBUG used for fine-grained tracing? Is INFO for business events?

### Required fields

Every log call must include at minimum:

| Field | Purpose | When required |
|---|---|---|
| Event name | What happened (the message) | Always |
| `request_id` / `trace_id` | Correlate logs across a request | Any code that handles an incoming request (HTTP, gRPC, queue consumer) |
| `user_id` | Who triggered the action | Any user-facing operation where a user ID is in scope |
| `error` / `err` | The error value or message | Any log at WARN or ERROR level |

If the codebase already uses these fields consistently, document them as required. If not, include them in the proposed pattern. Flag any log call that is in request-scoped code but omits `request_id` / `trace_id` as an inconsistency (Phase 3d).

### Pattern decision

- **If a clear pattern exists** (consistent message style, consistent fields, consistent logger instantiation): document it and treat any deviation as an inconsistency finding.
- **If no clear pattern exists** (< 5 log calls in the whole codebase, or wildly inconsistent): propose a pattern appropriate for the language and framework. State the proposed pattern at the top of the report so the user can accept or adjust it before acting on the recommendations.

**Recommended patterns by framework:**

*Python (structlog or logging):*
```python
log = structlog.get_logger(__name__)
log.info("order.placed", order_id=order_id, user_id=user_id)
# Message: noun.verb snake_case, context as keyword args
```

*Go (zap or slog):*
```go
logger.Info("order placed", zap.String("order_id", orderID), zap.String("user_id", userID))
// Message: lowercase prose, context as typed fields
```

*Java/Kotlin (SLF4J):*
```java
log.info("Order placed: orderId={}, userId={}", orderId, userId);
// Message: sentence case prose, context via SLF4J placeholders
```

*TypeScript/JS (pino or winston):*
```ts
logger.info({ orderId, userId }, 'Order placed')
// pino style: context object first, message second
```

## Phase 3: Scan for Issues

### 3a. Missing log statements

Look for code paths that almost certainly should be logged but aren't. Focus on high-value locations:

**Error handlers with no log:**
```bash
# Python
grep -rn "except " --include="*.py" -A 3 . | grep -v "log\|logger\|print" | head -20

# Java
grep -rn "catch\s*(" --include="*.java" -A 3 . | grep -v "log\.\|LOG\.\|logger\." | head -20

# Go
grep -rn "if err != nil" --include="*.go" -A 2 . | grep -v "log\.\|logger\." | head -20

# TypeScript
grep -rn "catch\s*(" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" -A 3 . | grep -v "console\.\|logger\.\|log\." | head -20
```

**Important operations with no surrounding log** — use these grep patterns to find high-value functions, then read them to check whether they log:

```bash
# Functions whose names signal state changes or side effects
grep -rn "def \(create\|update\|delete\|remove\|send\|publish\|process\|handle\|execute\|run\|dispatch\)_" \
  --include="*.py" .

grep -rn "func \(create\|update\|delete\|remove\|send\|publish\|process\|handle\|execute\|run\|dispatch\)[A-Z]" \
  --include="*.go" .

grep -rn "^\s*\(public\|private\|protected\).*\(create\|update\|delete\|send\|process\|handle\)[A-Z]" \
  --include="*.java" --include="*.kt" .

grep -rn "^\(export \)\?\(async \)\?function \(create\|update\|delete\|send\|process\|handle\)" \
  --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .
```

Also check these locations regardless of name:
- HTTP handlers / route controllers (any file in `handlers/`, `controllers/`, `routes/`, `views/`)
- Background jobs / scheduled tasks (`jobs/`, `workers/`, `tasks/`, `cron/`)
- Startup and shutdown sequences (main entry point, `init()`, signal handlers)

Flag an operation as missing a log if:
- It handles an error path with no log
- It completes a significant state change (create, update, delete) with no log
- It calls an external service with no log on failure
- It is a re-raise (exception caught and immediately re-thrown) with no log before the re-raise — the caller may never log it either, so this is the last chance

### 3b. Incorrect severity levels

For each log call found, evaluate whether the level matches the situation. Apply these rules:

| Level                | When to use                                                                                            | Common mistakes                                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DEBUG`              | Implementation details useful during development; disabled in production                               | Using DEBUG for events that operators need to see in prod              |
| `INFO`               | Normal, expected application flow; key business events                                                 | Logging every row in a loop as INFO; using INFO for recoverable errors |
| `WARN`               | Something unexpected happened but the application recovered; a condition that may cause problems later | Using WARN for actual errors; using WARN for routine things            |
| `ERROR`              | An operation failed and requires attention; may affect a user or data                                  | Swallowing errors silently; logging errors as WARN                     |
| `FATAL` / `CRITICAL` | Application cannot continue; imminent shutdown                                                         | Overusing FATAL for recoverable errors                                 |

**Exception handling rules** — apply these precisely when reading error-handling paths:

| Situation | Correct level | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Exception caught and **re-raised** | `ERROR` | The operation failed; the caller sees an exception. Log here so there is at least one record even if callers don't. |
| Exception caught and **handled** (request still succeeds) | `WARN` | Something unexpected happened but was recovered from. |
| Exception caught and **swallowed** (no re-raise, no response change) | Flag as **missing log** | Silent swallowing hides failures entirely. Always log before swallowing. |
| Expected, routine condition (e.g. cache miss, 404 lookup) | `DEBUG` or no log | Not an error; high-volume events at WARN/ERROR pollute alerting. |

**HTTP status code → log level mapping** — when code sets or returns an HTTP status, the log level should follow:

| Status range | Log level | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2xx | `INFO` (or no log if framework logs requests) | Success — normal flow |
| 3xx | `DEBUG` | Redirect — expected, low value |
| 4xx (client error) | `WARN` | Client made a bad request; server is fine |
| 5xx (server error) | `ERROR` | Server failed; needs attention |

```bash
# HTTP responses logged at wrong level (Python/Flask/FastAPI)
grep -rn "status_code\s*=\s*[45][0-9][0-9]\|return.*[45][0-9][0-9]" --include="*.py" -A 3 . | \
  grep "logger\.\(debug\|info\|warning\)"

# 5xx logged at warn instead of error (JS/TS)
grep -rn "res\.status(5[0-9][0-9])" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" -A 5 . | \
  grep "console\.warn\|logger\.warn"

# 4xx logged at error (over-alerting)
grep -rn "res\.status(4[0-9][0-9])" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" -A 5 . | \
  grep "console\.error\|logger\.error"
```

Also scan for:
```bash
# Errors logged at INFO or WARN (Python)
grep -rn "logger\.info\|logging\.info\|logger\.warning" --include="*.py" . | grep -i "error\|fail\|exception\|crash"

# Exceptions caught and logged at DEBUG
grep -rn "\.debug(" --include="*.java" --include="*.kt" . | grep -i "exception\|error\|fail"

# console.log used for errors in JS/TS
grep -rn "console\.log" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . | grep -i "error\|fail\|exception"
```

Read through error-handling paths in representative files — grep catches obvious mismatches, but reading reveals the subtler ones (e.g. a re-raise with no preceding log).

### 3c. Poor message quality

A good log message answers: *what happened, in what context, and why does it matter?*

Flag messages that:
- Are too vague to act on: `"Error"`, `"Something went wrong"`, `"Failed"`, `"null"`, `"done"`, `"ok"`
- Include no context when context is available: `"User not found"` when the user ID is in scope
- Are redundant with the exception type alone: `log.error("NullPointerException", e)` adds nothing
- Use inconsistent casing or tense compared to the established pattern
- Expose sensitive data: passwords, tokens, PII in log messages

```bash
# Vague messages (Python)
grep -rn "logger\.\w\+(['\"].\{1,20\}['\"])" --include="*.py" . | \
  grep -i '"error"\|"fail"\|"exception"\|"done"\|"ok"\|"success"\|"null"'

# Very short messages (Java)
grep -rn 'log\.\w\+("\w\{1,10\}")' --include="*.java" . | head -20
```

For files with message quality issues, read the surrounding code to suggest a better message that includes the relevant context variables.

### 3d. Inconsistency with the established pattern

Compare each log call against the pattern established in Phase 2:
- Logger instantiated differently than the norm
- Message casing or verb tense differs
- Structured fields used in some places but not others
- Required fields (from Phase 2) are missing — e.g. a log inside a request handler that omits `request_id`, or a WARN/ERROR log that omits `error`/`err`

## Phase 4: Output the Report

Group all findings into a single report. Order: **Missing logs → Wrong level → Poor messages → Inconsistencies**.

Within each section, order by file. For each finding include the file path, line number, the current code (if any), and a concrete suggested improvement.

Use this format:

```
## Logging Improvement Report

### Established Pattern
[State the detected or proposed pattern here. If proposed, prefix with "⚡ No consistent pattern found — proposing:"]

Example:
  logger.info("order.placed", order_id=order_id, amount=amount)
  # noun.verb message, structured keyword args, module-level logger

---

### 1. Missing Log Statements   (N findings)

**src/payments/processor.py:88** — error path with no log
  Context: `except StripeError as e:`
  Add: `logger.error("payment.charge_failed", order_id=order_id, error=str(e))`
  Why: stripe failures are silent — operators have no visibility when charges fail

**src/jobs/email_sender.py:34** — external call with no failure log
  Context: `response = smtp.send(msg)`
  Add (on failure): `logger.error("email.send_failed", recipient=msg.to, error=str(e))`

---

### 3. Incorrect Log Levels   (N findings)

**src/auth/login.py:52** — ERROR logged as WARNING
  Current:  `logger.warning("Login failed for user %s", user_id)`
  Suggest:  `logger.error("auth.login_failed", user_id=user_id)`
  Why: a failed login attempt is an error worth alerting on, not just a warning

**src/cache/client.py:19** — DEBUG in a tight loop producing log spam
  Current:  `logger.debug("Cache miss for key %s", key)` (called on every request)
  Suggest:  Remove or gate behind a feature flag; emit a summary metric instead

---

### 4. Poor Message Quality   (N findings)

**src/api/users.py:101**
  Current:  `logger.error("Error")`
  Suggest:  `logger.error("user.fetch_failed", user_id=user_id, error=str(e))`
  Why: "Error" is unactionable — which user, which operation, what went wrong?

**src/db/connection.py:14**
  Current:  `logger.info("Connected")`
  Suggest:  `logger.info("db.connected", host=host, port=port, database=db_name)`
  Why: context needed for debugging connection issues across environments

---

### 5. Inconsistencies   (N findings)

**src/orders/service.py:67** — unstructured message where structured is the norm
  Current:  `logger.info(f"Order {order_id} placed by {user_id}")`
  Suggest:  `logger.info("order.placed", order_id=order_id, user_id=user_id)`

---

### Summary

| Category              | Count |
|-----------------------|-------|
| Remove                |     2 |
| Missing log statements|     4 |
| Incorrect log levels  |     3 |
| Poor message quality  |     6 |
| Inconsistencies       |     5 |
| **Total**             |**20** |

### Recommended next steps
- Address "Remove" first — sensitive data in logs is an immediate security risk.
- Address "Missing log statements" next — silent error paths are the highest operational risk.
- Apply the established pattern to all new log calls going forward.
- Consider adding a linting rule to enforce log level discipline in CI.
```

If no issues are found in a section, omit that section entirely rather than writing "No issues found."

If the codebase has fewer than 5 log calls total, lead with the pattern proposal and focus the report on where to add logging rather than what to fix.
