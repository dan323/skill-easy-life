# Contributing a Skill

## Setup

No build step required. Clone the repo and install the marketplace to test locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dan323/agent-skills.git
cd agent-skills
```

Then in Claude Code: `/plugin marketplace add ./`

## Adding a New Skill

### 1. Create the plugin directory

```
plugins/<your-skill-name>/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── skills/
│   └── <your-skill-name>/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── evals/
    └── evals.json
```

### 2. Write SKILL.md

Start with the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: your-skill-name
description: >
  What this skill does and when Claude should use it.
  Include the specific user phrases that should trigger it
  (e.g. "find unused code", "clean up dead imports").
  Be direct about the trigger context — this is the primary
  matching mechanism.
tools: Bash, Read, Grep   # only list what you actually use
metadata:
  version: 1.0
---
```

Then write the body as numbered phases. See [Architecture](architecture.md) for the full format and design principles. Key rules:

- **Explain the why** behind each instruction — don't just say what to do, say why it matters. The agent has good judgment when it understands intent.
- **Prefer `Edit` over `Write`** for existing files to preserve content.
- **Include bash commands** for every data-gathering step — don't ask the agent to guess.
- **Define the output format explicitly** — show a concrete example of what the report or file should look like.
- **Never create placeholder pages** — only write content that has real information in it.

### 3. Write evals

Add at least 3 test cases to `evals/evals.json`. Each eval needs:

- A realistic **prompt** (what a real user would type)
- A **setup** script that creates a minimal repo for the test
- **Assertions** — plain-language statements that must be true of the output

```json
{
  "skill_name": "your-skill-name",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "prompt": "Find dead code in this project",
      "description": "Python file with one unused function and one used function",
      "setup": "mkdir -p /tmp/eval-0 && cd /tmp/eval-0 && git init && cat > main.py << 'EOF'\ndef used(): return 1\ndef unused(): return 2\nprint(used())\nEOF",
      "expected_output": "Only unused() is flagged. used() is not.",
      "files": [],
      "assertions": [
        {
          "id": "unused-flagged",
          "text": "unused() appears in the report as a dead code finding"
        },
        {
          "id": "used-not-flagged",
          "text": "used() does not appear as a dead code finding"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Good assertions are:
- **Objectively verifiable** — another agent can check them by reading the output
- **Specific** — not "the output looks right" but "the file contains a '### Added' section"
- **Discriminating** — they should fail on bad output, not pass on anything

### 4. Install and test manually

In Claude Code: `/plugin marketplace add ./` (from the repo root), then `/plugin install <your-skill-name>@agent-skills`.

Open a Claude Code session in a suitable test directory and run your trigger phrase. Iterate on the `SKILL.md` until the output matches your expectations, then run the evals with the `skill-creator` skill for a more rigorous check.

### 5. Submit a pull request

- One skill per PR
- Include at least 3 evals
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased] > ### Added`

## Improving an Existing Skill

1. Edit the relevant `plugins/<name>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and/or `evals/evals.json`
2. `/plugin update <name>@agent-skills` in Claude Code
3. Test the change manually, then run evals
4. Add a `### Changed` entry to `CHANGELOG.md`
